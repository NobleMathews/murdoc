# Handling VCS 

Murdock currently only supports GitHub for retrieving information directly from the git repository. 

- If missing keys are present and repository URL is available, Murdock scans dependency and license files available in the source
- Dependency files are chosen from the repository on each run based on the order of priority declared in the sections pertaining to each language 

:::{note}
To avoid conflicts the information from the previous steps is never overwritten and only missing information is appended in each iteration

## Rate Limits

Murdock internally checks for the amount of API requests remaining and sleeps until the reset time if the quota is exhausted

As long as the GitHub Token secret is available Murdock is subject to a rate limit of 5,000 requests per hour. If the package is run without authentication this limit reduces to 60 per hour.
