# MURDOC 

Welcome to murdock's documentation!

Murdock is a package analyzer written in [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/) for 
analysing sub-dependencies chains of packages in multiple languages. It is designed 
to be easily extensible and serve as a basis for license, vulnerability and deprecation
checks across the dependency chain.

:::{note}
Murdock can process Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust and PHP projects. GitHub is the only VCS provider currently supported.
