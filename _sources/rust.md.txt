# Handling Rust

Same as with python this is missing logic for understanding package specifier  

```
https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html
ignores tilde, wildcard, comparison, multiple
```

toml files handled similar to python

for lock files the name, version and dependencies are obtained using regex queries
